          <p>Michael and I met during our freshman year at Texas A&M. We both lived in a group of dorms called The Commons – I lived in Krueger and he lived in Mosher, but we could both be found hanging out in the Com Lob frequently. We have a few memories of each other from this year – when we were both at a backyard movie night, when my bridesmaid Ellen Taylor took Michael to our first crush party, and when I almost asked him to Theta Formal (someone else beat me to it!) I thought Michael was really cute, but I had no idea that he felt the same about me!</p>

          <p class="hide-mobile">Fast-forward to junior year. We’ve been at A&M for two and a half years, each making strong friendships separately. We’ve moved into houses in the same neighborhood, The Historic District; this is when our paths cross. One of the first weekends of our spring semester was Martin Luther King Jr. Day – paired with the fact that most of our friends didn’t have Friday classes that semester, it gave us a four day weekend of fun. On Friday afternoon, a group of friends gathered at Luther Jones Park to play an afternoon game of kickball. Little did we know the significance of this afternoon – the friends that gathered for that kickball game became our closest friends for the rest of our college years.</p>
          <p class="hide-mobile">Throughout the weekend, we continued to gather as a group to enjoy time together, then again gathered on Monday afternoon to play a game of kickball. After this kickball game, Michael and I walked back to my house, the Avocasa, ahead of the rest of our friends. When we arrived at the driveway, Michael asked me out on our first date, and of course I said yes! I had loved spending time with Michael that weekend. He made me laugh, he was incredibly kind, we had common interests of running and coding (nerdz), I knew he loved God and family, and he was really cute. He took me to one of my favorite local restaurants, La Bodega (RIP LaBo – Michael and I stole a keepsake menu before they closed!) and the rest is history.</p>
          <p class="hide-mobile">It amazes me to look back at that MLK weekend of junior year and see how God revealed the story he had been weaving for us all along. From that weekend grew the greatest group of friends that I could ever imagine – the friends we laugh with, adventure with, sports with, and the friends who have supported us, loved us, guided us, and cherished us along the way. From that weekend came a first date, then a second, and two years one week and one day later, a beautiful engagement at that same kickball field. I am incredibly thankful for this good gift from God!</p>
